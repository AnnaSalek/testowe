    <p>Spacewalking is dangerous and only performed when a job requires the skill and dexterity of a human—something that can’t be done by a robot. The process of doing a spacewalk is not just physically challenging due to the pressurized resistance of the suit, it is also mentally demanding. You have to focus on your work and your safety as well as using a vast number of potential tools and interacting with the crew on board and the Mission Control team. All the while, the clock is ticking and the universe is ready to kill you.
During a spacewalk you are supported by the crew inside the Station, who help to remind you where you are in the procedures or settings for the tools you are using. You have to work through your tasks with only an emergency checklist, as there is no practical way to carry a printed set of instructions. You are reliant on your crew and a spacewalk-experienced astronaut down on the ground to support you through the procedures. If you are the lead spacewalker, you are also responsible for keeping track of what the other astronaut is doing outside, as well as the cadence, safety, and completion of the entire EVA.
The experience of spacewalking is wildly different from being inside the spaceship. It’s akin to standing next to the window of a high-rise building versus being just a few feet over, but now outside that same window. For Chris, one of the most incredible spacewalk experiences was to walk through the Southern Lights while on the Canadarm2, something he likens to “surfing on the aurora.”
Spacewalking is also a huge honor for you, your family, your agency, and your country—for Chris, his initial EVA was extra special as he was the first Canadian to ever walk in space, an event celebrated on the back of Canada’s five-dollar bill.</p>
