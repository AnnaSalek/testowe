        <p>Commanding the planet’s only space station is a huge privilege, but also an unparalleled responsibility. In this role you are not only responsible for the ship and its singular place in the world’s space program, but also the lives of the crew on board.
In order to lead properly, you need to know what victory will look like. This is essential to then prioritizing the most important actions to take. For Chris and his crew on the ISS, they defined victory firstly as guaranteeing the survival of the crew, secondly as ensuring the survival of the ISS, and thirdly as conducting as much science as possible for the space agencies. A fourth measure of success was that when the mission was done, they all would be eager to start over, and do it again.
As the Commander, you must work to understand the people you lead—learning their language and culture as much as possible in the time available—and tirelessly build mutual understanding and respect. You have to be able to work constructively with not just the astronauts on board, but also with the Flight Directors and their teams in the Mission Control centers around the world.
Given the level of competence of astronauts on the ISS, the normal command structure on a day-to-day basis is flat and evenly distributed. Thus the role of the Commander is generally subtle, developing the crew ahead of launch and making sure they are protected and feel fulfilled pursing their own personal objectives. But in the case of a serious problem on board, the time for subtlety is over; the command structure moves from flat to vertical. Decisions need to be swift, clearly communicated and rapidly executed by the whole crew. Responding in an emergency is the ultimate test of the Commander.
You can never prepare too early to lead. Take time to think about the things that are important and liable to happen to you, and get ready for them, always. Even bad leaders can be great examples: pay attention to them to learn how not to lead ineffectively.</p>
